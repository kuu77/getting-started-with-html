<strong>What is the Web?</strong>
<br>
The Web is a collection of computers that communicate with one another remotely. A person's <em>workstation</em> accesses a <em>server</em> over the Web by sending it an 
<em>HTTP request</em>. The server finds the HTML document requested, and returns it to the user. The user's <em>Web browser</em> translates the HTML document into text, 
images, and other objects, to make it easy for the user to interpret.

<strong>What is HTML?</strong>
<br>
HTML, or <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>, is the markup language used to create Web pages. HTML documents are saved in a .html format, and a Web browser interprets these 
documents in a way that the average user can understand.

<br><br>

<strong>Elements</strong>
<br>
HTML <em>elements</em> are what make up HTML documents. Each element is distinguished by using different HTML <em>tags</em>. There are two types of elements: inline and block. 
<em>Inline</em> elements are a single tag, and have a simple function, such as a line break. <em>Block</em> elements on the other hand require a closing tag at the end of the 
element, telling the Web browser when the element ends.
